To run simply run the Scorer.exe file.

I havnt figured out how to make a system tray icon, so close in task manager.


Running a random .exe file is scary, create your own by:

Reading the python code and agreeing with what's happening.

pip install -r requirements.txt

auto-py-to-exe

Script: Code/Scorer.py 

Options: One file and window based

Run the Scorer.exe!
